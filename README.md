**Assignments completed for the Python Programming Data Science course Winter 2023** 

**Course Description**

This course is an introduction to Python, analysing and exploring data and doing machine learning with Python. 
Topics cover basics in Python programming language as well as visualization and exploratory data analysis in Python. 
Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn which are essential for data science will be introduced

**Assignment 1**

In assignment 1, I addressed each question thoroughly by implementing Python code according to the provided specifications. 
For example, in Question 1, I wrote code segments to fulfill different requirements such as counting down or up based on user input, 
calculating the volume of a sphere, finding the greatest common divisor, and displaying the first N prime numbers. Similarly, in Question 2, 
I developed Python programs to extract numbers from textual strings with different conditions, such as extracting only numeric values or 
extracting digits from words containing both letters and digits.

For Question 3, I implemented Python programs to calculate the approximation of Ï€ using Leibniz's formula, to approximate the Euler's number (e), 
and to compute the Sigmoid function for a given range of x values. I ensured that the programs covered all edge cases and provided accurate outputs. 
Additionally, I incorporated repetition statements where necessary to achieve the desired functionality.

Overall, I approached each question systematically, following the instructions provided and testing the code to ensure correctness. 
The solutions provided a clear demonstration of understanding the concepts and effectively addressed the requirements of the assignment.
